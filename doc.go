// Package verify contains the most useful type-safe fluent assertion functions.
//
// It also provides the FailureMessage type which you can use
// for creating your own fluent assertions.
//
// At last, you may embed a Fluent* type
// to extend it with additional assertion functions.
//
// Deprecated: avoid using assertion libraries.
// Use the standard library and [github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp] instead.
// Reference: https://go.dev/wiki/TestComments.
